# TurtleLink

A World of Warcraft addon for Turtle WoW that allows you to quickly copy database and auction house links for items.

## Description

TurtleLink enhances your gameplay by providing an easy way to generate and copy both Turtle WoW database links and WoWAuctions links for items in-game. When you hover over an item and use the appropriate keyboard shortcut, a window will appear with a copyable link.

   ```
4. Restart World of Warcraft if it's running

## Usage

1. Hover your mouse over any item in-game

   - `Ctrl+Shift`: Generate a database link (database.turtle-wow.org)
   - `Ctrl+Alt`: Generate an auction house link (wowauctions.net)
3. A window will appear with the appropriate link
4. The link will be automatically selected - just press Ctrl+C to copy it
